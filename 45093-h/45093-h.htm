<h2>TALL TALES OF SPORT AND ADVENTURE.</h2>

<p class="titleit">(By Mr. Punch's own Short Story-teller.)</p>

<p class="title">I.&mdash;THE PINK HIPPOPOTAMUS. (continued from page 81.)</p>

<p>In these awful circumstances, with the night air whistling past me,
and with my beloved <span class="smcap">Chuddah</span> and her nurse
hurtling upwards beside me, it is scarcely necessary for me to say
that I never for an instant lost my coolness and my perfect
self-possession. That the situation was dangerous, nay, almost
desperate, I fully realised, but it is in these very situations that
true courage and resourcefulness are always of the highest value.
Again and again in the course of my long life have I plucked safety,
aye, and that which is higher and better than all safety, namely,
reputation, from the nettle danger. Let fools prate as they will; the
brave man must always rise triumphant above the stormy waves of envy
and detraction.</p>

<p>These thoughts, I admit, did not occur to me at the moment. Our
flight was too perilous and too swift to allow me to think of aught
save what concerned the immediate necessities of this truly fearful
crisis. Poor little <span class="smcap">Chuddah</span>, I observed,
being made of lighter material, was gradually outstripping me in this
dreadful and involuntary race. First her head topped me; then her
shoulders soared beyond me; at last her feet were on a level with my
face. As one of them (I forget which) passed upwards, I was just able
by leaning slightly forward, to imprint a kiss upon it. "Farewell,
<span class="smcap">Chuddah</span>," I sighed, as the lovely foot left
my lips. "Farewell, <span class="smcap">Orlando</span>," she murmured
all but inaudibly, and fled up, up, up into the dismal night. I never
saw her again.</p>

<p>The Ayah, however, a stout and heavy woman, was still beside me,
rising inch for inch as I rose. By turning slightly round I could look
at her. I did so. Judge of my horror when I realised by the faint
light of the stars that the Ayah was no longer alive! The shock of the
sudden ascent must have proved too much for one accustomed to the
sedate and comfortable life of an eastern palace, and enfeebled,
moreover, by advancing age. The explosion acting on such a
constitution had snapped the cords that kept life in her faithful
body. The Ayah was dead, and I who tell this tale was alone with a
corpse in the encircling atmosphere! As I realised this horrible
situation, I confess that for the first and last time in my life I
turned faint with a feeling almost amounting to fear. In imagination I
saw myself speeding for ever, as the &aelig;ons revolved in their
courses, with only a dead Indian nurse to keep me company. Then, by an
instantaneous revulsion, the grim humour of the situation struck me.
With only my knapsack of provisions and my brandy-flask, it was
unlikely, even under the most favourable circumstances, that I should
be able to prolong life for more than a week. At the end of a week,
then, I too should be a corpse. I laughed aloud as I thought of the
last scion of the <span class="smcap">Wilbrahams</span>, the
unconquerable <span class="smcap">Orlando</span>, mated in mid-air to
the dusky Ayah, a skeleton to a skeleton, and my sepulchral "Ha, ha,"
went reverberating through the dim spaces of night. The sound roused
me once more. Why, after all, should I die? Life was sweet; much
remained to be done; there were wrongs still to be redressed in the
world below; millions of the oppressed still waited for a deliverer;
countless herds of big game still roamed the prairies or made their
lairs in the forests of earth. No, I would live if I could, and prove
once more the unquenchable fortitude of my race.</p>

<p>At this moment I looked down.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>To be continued.</i>)</p>

<h2>BAR NONE!</h2>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Now that the Law lectures at the different Inns
have been "thrown open to the public," <i>any</i> outrage in the way
of cringing to the democracy may be expected. They'll be opening
Lincoln's Inn Fields next to the mob!</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;They <i>have!</i> And a steam merry-go-round set
up within thirty yards of my formerly tranquil Chambers! Oh, why was I
ever called?</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Dinner in Hall to-day. Found two perfect
strangers dining at my table! Seems that the Benchers have thrown open
dining-hall to the public as well! Asked strangers if they intended
being called to the Bar? One of them replied (with a wink) that
<i>he</i> didn't&mdash;why should he? He could get all the legal training,
use of library, &amp;c., without going to expense of a call.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;In Court. Unknown Counsel opposed to me. Seem to
recognise his face. <i>Can</i> it be the stranger who dined in Hall
last night? It is. New rule has thrown the Courts open to amateur
pleaders! What <i>are</i> we coming to? Must say stranger pleads
uncommonly well. And Judge <i>so</i> deferential to him!</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Wonders never cease. To-day my stranger of
yesterday found seated on Bench! Judge ill&mdash;has appointed him as
Commissioner in his place. New rule allows this sort of thing. What is
the reason of this sudden democratising of the Profession?</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Mystery explained. One of the Benchers wants to
be made a L. C. C. Alderman! In his Election Address he even stoops so
far as to give way to the vulgar delusion that Law is expensive, and
recommends a rule that costs should always be "on the lower scale."
Perhaps he is right. Everything on the lowest possible scale at Bar
nowadays!</p>

<h2>TRANCEMOGRIFICATION.</h2>

<p>Now that hypnotism is in the air, our conversation-books will have
to be remodelled, as thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Good morning, have you hibernated well?</p>

<p>Yes, I have had a most successful trance this winter. Have you laid
up at all?</p>

<p>Only for a few days at Christmas, just to escape the bills. I had a
delightfully unconscious Boxing Day.</p>

<p>Well, you take my advice old man, and rent a private catacomb on
the three-years' system. It comes much cheaper in the end, and you
save all your coal and gas, to say nothing of clothes.</p>

<p>We've started a Nirvana Club in our neighbourhood on the tontine
principle. The last person who wakes gets the prize, unless the first
who comes to makes off with it.</p>

<p>It is capital, anyway, when you are taking a tour. Saves all the
trouble of sight-seeing. You are just packed up and forwarded from
place to place, with an automatic Kodak which records everything you
visited. Try it!</p>

<p>Will, some day. By Jove, I must be off! I've got to attend an
an&aelig;sthetic concert, absolutely painless.</p>

<p>And I've got a mesmeric dinner-party on to-night. All the bores
will be put in glass-cases, and fed mechanically.</p>

<p>Good-bye, then. Sleep well!</p>

<p class="title1">THE TURNCOCK</p>

<p>This eminent individual, born in the early forties, comes of a
numerous family, and was originally destined by his parents for the
career of a night-watchman. Not feeling, however, any vocation in this
direction, he tried many other professions, and many other professions
tried <i>him</i>. At last, in the year 1864, he entered the service of
the Twiddlesex Water Company, where, by strict attention to the
quality of his liquor, and his unfailing perception of the right time
to be sober, he has risen to his present conspicuous and responsible
position.</p>

<h2>OF THE ART OF TOBOGGANING.</h2>

<p class="right"><i>Canton des Grisons, Feb. 10.</i></p>

<p>For the neighbourhood it is a sultry day; glass up to 5&deg;
Fahrenheit and a taint of scirocco, or <i>f&ouml;hn</i>, as the
facetious native calls this wind. My toboggan lies idle by stress of
drifting snow. "No chance," I say, "of doing a record this afternoon!"
This is what I say openly and pompously to my fellows. With my own
dear heart I commune otherwise, saying how heaven should be praised
for this one blessed day's recess from broken scalp.</p>

<p>If I have asked myself once (as is proper with an enigma) I have
asked myself a thousand times, "Why did I come out here, to this
resort of invalids and polar athletes?" My right lung is flawless: my
left is very perfect. On the other hand I do not show well on ice; my
legs are ill-shaped for bandy; curling I find to be but poor sport
after skittles; and I have met one wayfarer only, and that a fool, who
did not laugh upon my figure-skating.</p>

<p>In a climate where one must either do or suffer something to
justify one's existence, there remained this sole thing&mdash;to toboggan.
I said, "I will surely toboggan!"</p>

<p>"Good!" they said; "but on an instrument of what sort? 'Swiss' for
women and children; ordinary 'Americas' for men; 'Skeleton Americas'
for heroes."</p>

<p>"I will choose the last," I said; for if I do anything at all I
like to do it passing well, and with the best of tools.</p>

<p>There was no lack of willing teachers to illustrate for me the true
posture&mdash;<i>ventre &agrave; terre</i>, and to show me how I should go
armed as to my Alpine boots with spiked rakes screwed to the forefront
of my sole for the better negotiation of sharp angles on the side of a
ravine.</p>

<p>One may add that if a pine-tree, or a telegraph post, or an
ascending hay-sleigh opposes your career, you learn by the simple
interposition of your head to save the delicate machinery of the
toboggan from brutalization. It may be that by inadvertence you have
attained an impetus so terrific that you overtake a walking horse in
possession of the path. Once again your headpiece will protect the
instrument from the fiery choler of the beast's hind hoof. After some
two miles of fortuitous descent, diversified by such checks as I have
here shadowed forth, you will be rounding the final corner at a
pointed angle of 45&deg;, travelling perhaps several miles per hour,
when a large beer-cart with an upward tendency will dispute the road.
Then the banked snow shall be your pall, and your <i>requiescat</i>
shall be rendered by the local teamster in German of a bastard
order.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. To the beetling edge of the descent you will first
have been conveyed by an impetuous <i>zwei-sp&auml;nner</i>,
thoughtlessly gay with bells and feathers. Twenty-five candidates
having urged their claims for the five seats, some will have need to
be content to trail behind on their toboggans. As one wanting in
experience, you will have the last place assigned to you, or else the
last but one, with a casual riderless machine at the tail-end to give
you an unholy spasm as it swings off the track round the corners. At
intervals, while your pensive mind is absorbed upon the maintenance of
a happy equilibrium, rendered strangely-difficult by the ruthless
speed of the sleigh, some two or perhaps three of the tailing-party
will fall off in front. The sharp contact of several raked boots with
your open countenance draws your attention to the altered condition of
things. Over the mangled bodies of friend and foe you are carried
forward. The sleigh is tardily arrested, and your innocent head
becomes the recipient of fearless abuse.</p>

<p>Or again, from some mountain-hut upon the route issues forth a
gross and even elephantine dog, born of unhallowed union between a
wolfhound and an evilly-bred St. Bernard. Foiled in his attack upon
the head of the caravan he revenges himself upon the outstretched leg
of the hindmost. The lacerated calf will be your own.</p>

<p>This is well enough in open daylight, and when you are swathed in
buskins from heel to hip, and your rakes are good for retaliation. But
in doubtful moonlight with the air at 15&deg; below zero, as you
toboggan back to your hostelry in the valley from a fancy dress ball,
where you have simulated <i>Hamlet</i> in black silk tights and pumps,
the humour lies purely on the side of the dog.</p>

<p>But apart from the lower animal nature, in this barbaric sport you
are never confident of your dearest friends. Thus, we had been a
pleasant and hilarious party at the international <i>bal masqué:</i>
the ardour of the stirrup-cup was still upon us as we attained the
brow of the decline. By a happy inspiration I had proposed that my
friend Mr. <span class="smcap">Stark Munro</span>, being a
heavy-weight and disguised as a <i>V&ouml;lsunga Saga</i>, should
proceed in the van to clear any incidental drift or desultory
avalanche. He disappeared headlong down the pine-forest track followed
by the Ace of Clubs, a Sardinian Brigand, and a Tonsured Benedictine.
All the costumes gained in picturesqueness from the Arctic
background.</p>

<p>The New Woman of the party, attired as Good Queen
<span class="smcap">Bess</span>, begged me to precede her, arguing
that I should go faster on my Skeleton than she on her Swiss. I
engaged to do so on the understanding that she should allow me seven
minutes' start in case of eventualities, the course being usually done
in some 5&frac34; minutes under happy conditions. She was to be
succeeded by Antigone, the Spirit of the Engadine and the Mother of
the Gracchi.</p>

<p>I do not greatly care to linger over the details of my descent. I
had started gaily humming those Elizabethan lines, "Fain would I
climb, but that I fear to fall,"&mdash;out of pure gallantry to Good Queen
<span class="smcap">Bess</span> who had given me a dainty little
cow-bell as a favour at the <i>cotillon;</i> and I had been travelling
cautiously for 8&frac12; minutes, with my nose, no fewer than six
fingers, and all the toes on each foot frostbitten, and a half-moon
piece already gone out of my calf at the spot where it had attracted
the notice of the St. Bernard wolf-hound, when, even as I was
navigating a rotten bridge at a sharp turn, I heard a rushing sound
out of the night behind me, and "<i>Achtung!</i>" (the terrible
warning-note of the tobogganer) rang in my stricken ear.</p>

the Gracchi and Good Queen <span class="smcap">Bess</span> (herself
unscratched, though the plush of her toboggan was tarnished with my
gore). I was solemnly intoning, "World without end: <i>Achtung!</i>"

<p>"Ah! old men's boots don't go there, Sir," said the boot-maker to
me one day, rather pointedly, pointing to the toes of the boots I had
brought him for mending. As I danced home, writing another chronicle
with every springing step, the remark filled me with reflection&mdash;such
reflection, reader, as your mirror shows you when you gaze in it to
rejoice in your own beauty.</p>

<p>Have you kept a diary for thirty years? Dear me! And have you kept
your gas bills, your water-rates, your Christmas-cards, your writs,
your circulars of summer sales? I might never have undertaken to write
this biography if I had not chanced one evening&mdash;being unoccupied&mdash;to
break open a private desk belonging to my friend
<span class="smcap">Narcissus</span>, and tearing open an envelope
(sealed, and labelled "<i>Compromising Postcards&mdash;to be opened before

the manner in which there lay revealed in them the story of the years
over which they ran....</p>

<h3>SCRAP II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Happy Home.</span></h3>

<p>The first night we went to see <span class="smcap">George
Donkeystir</span> we heard in the kitchen a curious voice&mdash;suggestive
somehow of the vine-leaves in the hair&mdash;singing "<i>Ours is a Happy,
Happy Home!</i>" In the hall we saw none but a wee boy of four,
standing on his head, balancing a billiard-cue on his chin.</p>

</div>

<p>"All done by kindness!" lisped the little chap. As we made an
attempt to enter the dining-room, what should fall on our heads but a
great wet sponge, backed by a ring of laughter from the hidden
prompter, and <span class="smcap">George</span> appeared, shouting
"Bo!" followed by the loving wife, who helped to make the fun
possible. What a time we had! From the moment we arrived (and fell
over a string adroitly arranged by the dear little children across
the little hall) to the moment that we had got into our little
apple-pie beds, all was fun, frolic, merriment, and domestic joy. Just
as we were falling asleep, tired out with a happy evening, we were
disturbed by a chorus, as of <i>waits</i>, singing outside our room
these beautiful words&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem width18"><div class="stanza">
<p>"O! <span class="smcap">Flo</span>, what a change you know!</p>

<p>This was more of <span class="smcap">George's</span> loving ingenuity. But we wished he
had made it rhyme. His wife had helped him, but she would not
take the credit. "That was <span class="smcap">George's</span> idea," laughed along her lips.
I threatened "to make copy" of him, and now I have done it.
Moreover, I shall further presume on his forbearance by writing no
more about him for the present.</p>

Now the title of this song is its refrain, <i>i.e.</i>, "Come,

lover's passionate invitation, while if it is written as "<i>Come,

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bonner</span> has done well to write a
record of the life and work of her father, <span class="smcap">Charles
Bradlaugh</span>, which <span class="smcap">Fisher Unwin</span>
publishes in two volumes. If it had been one 'twould have been better.
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bonner</span> has been assisted in her
labours by Mr. <span class="smcap">J. M. Robertson</span>, who deals
with Mr. <span class="smcap">Bradlaugh's</span> political doctrine and
work, and describes in detail his parliamentary struggle. The
consequence is that the record runs into two closely-printed volumes,
a proportion that somewhat overweights the interest of the subject.
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bonner</span> is, naturally, indignant at the
treatment her father received in the early days of his parliamentary
life and in other public relations. But Mr.
<span class="smcap">Bradlaugh</span> was a fighting man. He gave hard
knocks and, to do him justice, did not unduly complain when knocks
were dealt back to him. It is a pathetic story how the crowning
triumph of his life came in the hour of his death. He never knew that
the House of Commons had unanimously agreed to the motion which
expunged from its journals the resolution excluding the junior member
for Northampton from its membership. That confession, my Baronite
says, was the completest justification of the action on Mr.
<span class="smcap">Bradlaugh</span>'s part that enlivened the
Parliament of 1880-5 and was the immediate cause of the birth of the
Fourth Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">John Davidson's</span> <i>Earl Lavender</i>
is "pernicious nonsense," and the Aubrey Beardsley frontispiece&mdash;if,
considering its subject, it can, with absolute correctness, be
described <i>as</i> a "<i>front</i>ispiece,"&mdash;might, a few years ago,
have endangered its existence. But "I suppose," quoth the Baron, "I am
becoming old-fashioned, and 'we have changed all that now.' But in
view of this extraordinary illustration, is it a book that can be left
out 'promiscuously-like' on the drawing-room table? I trow not," quoth
the Baron. "And as to <i>The Great God Pan</i> ('Key-note' series),
well&mdash;infernally or diabolically clever it may be, but should I be
informed," quoth the Baron, "that we should never look upon its like
again, I, for one should not grieve."</p>

<p>Another Keynoteworthy book, <i>i.e.</i>, one quite worthy to belong
to such of the Key-note series as the Baron has read, is <i>The
Dancing Faun</i>. Had a novel appeared some years ago in the palmy,
but not less leggy, days of the drama at the Gaiety, entitled <i>The
Dancing Vaughan</i>, when the elegant <span class="smcap">Kate</span>
of that ilk was the light and leading <i>danseuse</i>, what a vogue
such a volume would have had among the patrons of the above-mentioned
Temple of Burlesque-Extravaganza. "<i>O&ugrave; sont les neiges

<h2>SIGNS OF THE TIMES.</h2>

<p>At the re-opening of the Royal United Service Institution last week
by H.R.H. the Prince of <span class="smcap">Wales</span>, in new
premises at Whitehall, a novel and ingenious electrical instrument was
exhibited. By means of this addition to the list of communicators a
general in the field is able not only to send an autograph letter to a
colleague or subordinate at a distance, but also to convey in <i>fac
simile</i> a drawing of his own composition. On the occasion to which
reference is made, the Prince of <span class="smcap">Wales</span> sent
a message to his brother. To this despatch the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Connaught</span> was obliged to respond that he
did not quite understand its full meaning. According to the reports
some slight error was rectified, and then the machine worked to
everyone's satisfaction. However, the fact remains that the initial
attempt to convey intelligibly a message was not entirely successful.
To impress upon those answerable for the perfect action of the
instrument the importance of their task, we subjoin an imaginary scene
of a nearly impossible situation. We will assume that a
commander-in-chief is conversing with a general in the field some ten
miles distant.</p>

<p><i>Commander-in-Chief</i> (<i>wiring</i>). We hear here that a
force of twenty-five thousand infantry are advancing by the Dover road
with a view to turning your left front.</p>

<p><i>General in the Field.</i> Kindly repeat. (<i>Message
repeated.</i>) No, we do not want any more marmalade, as we have
plenty of butter.</p>

<p><i>C.-in-C.</i> I said nothing about marmalade, I was talking of
the enemy. Twenty-five thousand men are advancing on your left
front.</p>

<p><i>Gen.</i> I think I now understand what you mean, but we can't
get near Woolwich, because our gas has failed us. However, we will
look out for the twenty-five thousand balloons you say are coming.</p>

<p><i>C.-in-C.</i> I said nothing about balloons. Infantry, I spoke
of. They are approaching by the Dover Road.</p>

<p><i>Gen.</i> Thank you for your offer, but we have plenty of
hammocks. We have just seen this. Can you identify her? I forward
sketch.</p>

<p><i>C.-in-C.</i> You have sent me what appears to be a drawing of
either a grand pianoforte or a hippopotamus. Which is it?</p>

<p><i>Gen.</i> It is very difficult to make out your messages. We
think we understand your last. Yes, the mail to India did start
without the elephants. We did not know that any had been ordered.</p>

<p><i>C.-in-C.</i> I said nothing about elephants. What is the meaning
of your drawing?</p>

<p><i>Gen.</i> Very sorry; can't make out your message. Besides, have
no more time for telegraphing. Twenty-five thousand infantry of the
enemy have just been noticed on the Dover Road, threatening our left
front. Why did you not tell us they were coming?</p>

<p>But of course, as we have already said, when the hour arrives
everything will be in perfect working order. It is to be hoped that
there will be a supplementary signal to be used in cases of extreme
emergency, to decide promptly a line of action where two courses are
open for adoption. It might signify "Toss up."</p>

<h2>"THE RIVALS" AT THE A. D. C.</h2>

<p class="indent1">Once again I salute you, oh actors of the Cambridge A. D. C., and
congratulate you on your rendering of <i>The Rivals</i>&mdash;no mean task
for a body of amateur actors. Specially do I note the admirably and
grotesquely humorous impersonation of <i>Mrs. Malaprop</i> by Mr.
<span class="smcap">R. A. Austen Leigh</span>. Will the elaborate
Wildean paradoxes have to a future generation the freshness and the
laughter-provoking qualities of <i>Mrs. Malaprop's</i> derangements?
I doubt it. At Cambridge the other day I saw a learned Doctor of
Letters in convulsions over the Malapropian sallies. Will a Doctor of
Letters towards the end of the next century be seen to smile over
<span class="smcap">Oscar's</span> inversions? Mr.
<span class="smcap">R. Balfour</span> made an excellent <i>Bob
Acres</i>, broad in his characterisation, self-possessed and clear. I
should have called him, however, a trifle too smart and modish in
dress. Mr. <span class="smcap">Geikie</span> was very effective in the
rages of <i>Sir Anthony</i>, and Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>
played well as <i>Jack Absolute</i>. Admirable, too, was the
<i>Fag</i> of Mr. <span class="smcap">Talbot</span>. The leading
ladies were, as usual, miracles of curls and divine complexions. Yet
did their voices and their hands bewray them. We were fortunately
spared the gloomy maunderings of <i>Julia</i> and <i>Faulkland</i>.

<p><i>Algy</i> (<i>eating cucumber-sandwiches</i>). Do you know, Aunt
<span class="smcap">Augusta</span>, I am afraid I shall not be able to
come to your dinner to-night, after all. My friend
<span class="smcap">Bunbury</span> has had a relapse, and my place is
by his side.</p>

<p><i>Aunt Augusta</i> (<i>drinking tea</i>). Really,
<span class="smcap">Algy</span>! It will put my table out dreadfully.
And who will arrange my music?</p>

<p><i>Dorian.</i> <i>I</i> will arrange your music, Aunt
<span class="smcap">Augusta</span>. I know all about music. I have an
extraordinary collection of musical instruments. I give curious
concerts every Wednesday in a long latticed room, where wild gipsies
tear mad music from little zithers, and I have brown Algerians who
beat monotonously upon copper drums. Besides, I have set myself to
music. And it has not marred me. I am still the same. More so, if
anything.</p>

has a beautiful nature. And it is <i>such</i> a blessing to think that
he was not brought up in a handbag, like so many young men of the
present day.</p>

<p><i>Algy.</i> It is such a blessing, Aunt

like her aunt. It is such a curse that a man never grows exactly like
his uncle. It is the greatest tragedy of modern life.</p>

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="title">Extracted from the Diary of
Toby, M.P.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, February 18.</i>&mdash;Debate on Address
finished, at last. Been on the whole dreary business. Instead of sharp
roar of honest artillery from Opposition camp at opening of campaign,
series of squibs popped off; some of them damp. Novel idea at
commencement of new Session for Opposition chiefs to lurk in the wood
armed with blunderbusses, watching efforts of lesser villains to
waylay and murder Ministers, they coming on scene when these efforts
been repulsed. Novel, but on whole not so successful that we are
likely to see repetition.</p>

<p>Odd thing is that in series of divisions Government had nearest
squeak on motion for the Closure. <span class="smcap">S. Woods</span>
had amendment on paper; wanted to have debate adjourned so that
another day might be appropriated for his use;
<span class="smcap">Squire of Malwood</span> thought really been
enough talk round Address. Moved closure.
<span class="smcap">Woods</span> and two or three other good Radicals
go into Lobby against Ministers; others abstain; Opposition seeing
opportunity flock into Lobby; Ministry saved by eight votes.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the <span class="smcap">Squire of Malwood</span> as we
walked home together, after last division, "it is not exactly
encouraging. But what distresses me most is the way some of our
fellows talk about <span class="smcap">Rosebery</span>. Used to be old
constitutional maxim that the King can do no wrong. Modern reading on
our side is that <span class="smcap">Premier</span> can do no right.
Speeches like <span class="smcap">Dilke's</span> to-night hurt me more
than anything else." This conversation followed close on one I had
earlier in day with the noble lord.</p>

<p>"How's the Squire looking?" he asked, anxiously. "Bearing up I
trust, against the fatigues of a thankless task. What a few of our men
say about me not the slightest consequence. Passes over me like
fluttering of idle wind. Know all about it. Could, an' I would,
describe animating motive in each case. What cuts me to the heart is
their treatment of the <span class="smcap">Squire</span>. He manages
admirably. Spares no labour; makes no mistake. Yet whenever some men
returned to support us are not permitted to take in own hands
direction of public business, they go over to the enemy. Great
blessing the <span class="smcap">Squire</span> is endowed by nature
with angelic temper. Otherwise, when this sort of thing happens, he
would chuck up the whole business, and tell malcontents and deserters
to manage matters for themselves."</p>

<p>So nice to have this state of things existing. Sufferers in common
affliction, each thinks only of the other.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Address agreed to after ten days talk.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday Night.</i>&mdash;Every prospect of quiet evening, even talk
of count out. After spending our nights and days with Address during
last fortnight, small wonder if the hearts of Members, untravelled,
fondly turn to home. Diversion created by appearance on scene of
<span class="smcap">Howard Vincent</span>. Got up in extraordinary
fashion. Round his waist a belt, in which slung miscellaneous
assortment of brushes and other articles of domestic use. Pendent were
hair brushes, hat brushes, tooth brushes, boot brushes (with case in
solid leather), whisk brooms, carpet sweepers, wall brushes,
chimney-sweeping machine (with whalebone head and chimney cloth), deck
scrubbers, one venetian blind-duster, feather brushes (eight feet long
with jointed handles), floor polishers, hearth brushes (white hair and
black), lamp brushes, aid one hair waver patent for producing in a few
minutes, without the use of heated irons, a natural wavy appearance in
the hair. (<span class="smcap">Frank Lockwood</span> much interested
in this.)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span></p>

<p>Other brushes peeped out from every pocket save those at
coat-tails, which, as being more roomy, were reserved for specimens of
filters, fish-kettles, bread-platters, revolving boot-cleaners,
specimens of boxes in which eggs may be safely sent through the
parcel-post, and a lemon-squash stand (oak and nickel mounts complete,
with four tumblers, corkscrew, lemon-knife, and glass sugar
basin).</p>

<p class="center">Colonel Howard Vincent bristles with indignation, and has a brush
with the enemy.</p>
</div>

<p>"Been to a bazaar?" I asked; "or are you going to give up military
pursuits, and set up a stall somewhere on your own account?"</p>

<p>"No, <span class="smcap">Toby</span>," said the Colonel,
severely&mdash;"would you just hitch round the handle of that frying-pan?
Thank you; it might get in <span class="smcap">Bartley's</span> way
whilst I am addressing the House&mdash;these few things you see only
partially concealed about my person are the result of the labours of
convicts and felons working in foreign prisons. A Government lost to
all sense of public duty permits their free importation, to the
detriment of honest British workman. You'd better stop and hear me
broil <span class="smcap">Bryce</span>."</p>

<p>Colonel walked off with curious clatter, much more effective than
the spurs he wears on field days with the Queen's Westminster
Volunteers. Most interesting lecture, occasionally marred by Colonel,
intending at particular point to produce a blacking-brush, fishing
forth from his miscellaneous store a plated biscuit-box. But the moral
all the same. The articles all made in Germany or elsewhere on
Continent. <span class="smcap">Bryce</span> glad to get out of
difficulty by offering Committee.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Motion carried for restriction of foreign
prison-made goods.</p>

<p><i>Thursday Afternoon.</i>&mdash;"Hist!" said Sir
<span class="smcap">Henry James</span> to <span class="smcap">Joey
C.</span> "A word in thine ear. <span class="smcap">Prince
Arthur</span> away to-night; ground clear; suppose we occupy it? show
<span class="smcap">Prince Arthur</span> how we would manage business,
and let the <span class="smcap">Markiss</span> see that there are
statesmen other than those who hail from Hatfield and its
dependencies. Here's this import duty added on British yarn entering
India. Lancashire members sore about it. Don't know much on subject
myself, but can do simple rule in arithmetic. If we can detach seven
or eight Lancashire Liberals and put on all our forces, the Government
must go. Think how pleasant for <span class="smcap">Prince
Arthur</span>, sitting with his feet in hot water and his head out of
the window, to hear the tramp of our messenger along Carlton House
Terrace bringing news that Government is out. If we'd only time we
might hire man with wooden-leg, like the party in <i>Treasure
Island</i>, wasn't it? Sound of wooden-leg tramping along silent
broadway where <span class="smcap">Prince Arthur</span> lives, and is
just now nursing his cold, would be most dramatic. That a mere detail.
Thing is this, Indian cotton business is so much gun-cotton for
Government; I apply torch; up they
go&mdash;<span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>,
<span class="smcap">Fowler</span>, <span class="smcap">Asquith</span>
(who was so rude to you the other night), and the rest of them. What
do you think?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joey C.</span> is sly, de-vilish sly; said
nothing. But he winked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry James</span> knew that all was well.</p>

<p><i>Friday</i>, 12.10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>&mdash;Not quite so
well as it looked when House met at three o'clock yesterday afternoon.
Ministerialists then in state of trepidation; Ministers assuming air
of resignation. Odds distinctly in favour of defeat of Government.
<span class="smcap">Henry Fowler</span>, formally recognising
situation, had declared they were prepared for the worst. Somehow
things got mixed; explosion took place as arranged; gun-cotton went
off with genial roar; but it was <span class="smcap">Henry
James</span> blown into the air, and with him <span class="smcap">Joey
C.</span> 109 Members mustered under new Opposition Leadership; 304
going with Ministers. Majority, 195.</p>

<p>"Glad I didn't engage the messenger with a wooden leg," said
<span class="smcap">Henry James</span> with deepened gloom. "Awful to
have a man of that kind going stamping through a quiet thoroughfare in
the dead of the night carrying news of Government majority of a trifle
under 200. Wish <span class="smcap">Prince Arthur</span> would stick
to his post and not take colds at such inconvenient seasons."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Henry James</span> and
<span class="smcap">Joey C.</span> go out to shear and come back
shorn.</p>

<p><i>Friday</i>, 8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&mdash;House counted
out. Members gone home in state of hair-bristling perturbation.
<span class="smcap">Brunner</span> brought under notice of
<span class="smcap">Speaker</span> circumstances attendant upon
mysterious disappearance of <span class="smcap">Joey C.</span> last
night. When House cleared for division on
<span class="smcap">James's</span> motion,
<span class="smcap">Joe</span> seen to leave and go into Lobby.
Thereafter all trace lost of him. Name does not appear in division
list. Witnesses report he was seen endeavouring to induce
<span class="smcap">Serjeant-at-Arms</span> to unlock door and let him
pass through. <span class="smcap">Serjeant</span> incorruptible,
inflexible. <span class="smcap">Joseph</span> turned back and
straightway lost to human ken.</p>

<p>"When I was a lad," says <span class="smcap">Wilfrid Lawson</span>,
"I used to be baffled by inquiry, 'Where was
<span class="smcap">Moses</span> when the candle went out?' That a
plain proposition compared with this new one, 'Where was
<span class="smcap">Joseph</span> when the division was taken?'" House
faced by mystery could not set itself down to business. Something
uncanny about the place. Accordingly got itself counted out at eight
o'clock.</p>
